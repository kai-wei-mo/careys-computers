## Description
*Carey's Computers* was the summative project for the ICS3U course. The project is best described as a simple, e-commerce website written dynamically with PHP that uses MySQL databases to fetch and display product information. This project features the languages HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.

### Installation Dependencies
- a web browser
- local web server

In the ICS3U course, we were instructed to use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) as it was a simple, lightweight, cross-platform Apache distribution that allows for creation of local web servers on a whim. 

### How to Use
1. Visit ``localhost/manager.php`` to populate the local database.
2. Visit ``localhost/index.php`` to open the website.
